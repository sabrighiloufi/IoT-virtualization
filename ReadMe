Recently, many researchers focused on the virtualization of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) due to the growing service domain for the Internet of Things (IoT). WSN virtualization consists of creating virtual sensors that share the sensing capabilities of physical sensors. As in cloud computing, the management of virtual sensors requires a virtual sensor hypervisor. In this work, we propose and develop a virtual sensor hypervisor that allows creating, deleting, activating, and migrating virtual sensors. It is a Java-based application that managed a WSN created using Cooja simulator.
